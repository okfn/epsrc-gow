# [EPSRC Grant portfolio](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/)

As of 2012-05-28, the EPSRC "Grants on the Web" database contains grants dating back to 1985:

- 43,317 grants
- Â£10,935,828,250 of committed funding

This repository contains tools for scraping and manipulating this data into a useful format.

## Quick access

Instead of using the code in this repository, why not download the database generated by it? A listing of these can be found [at CKAN](http://thedatahub.org/dataset/epsrc-gotw).

- [Latest database](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ckannet-storage/2012-05-28T175551/dump.sql.bz2) (SQL format, updated 2012-05-28)
- [See this data visualised at OpenSpending](http://openspending.org/epsrc-gotw)

## Setup

To get up and running, you will need `python` and `pip`. Instructions for installing `python` are beyond the scope of this document, but you should be able to get `pip` if you don't have it by running:

    $ easy_install pip

If you use `virtualenv`, you might want to create an environment to play around in:

    $ virtualenv --distribute pyenv
    $ source pyenv/bin/activate

Now install the scraper and its dependencies:

    $ pip install -e .

Create the database (or migrate your existing database to the current schema version) by running:

    $ ./migrate.sh epsrc.db 4

## Usage

This scraper operates on a local mirror of the EPSRC GOW website. You must first make this mirror (this will take a *long* time to complete, often several days):
 
    $ wget -c -m gow.epsrc.ac.uk

Then you can use the `epsrc-scrape` tool to parse this data:

    $ epsrc-scrape epsrc.db ./gow.epsrc.ac.uk

Each grant has a unique grant reference, e.g. `GR/J50118/01`. We can check that the example grant above made it into the database with the following command

    $ sqlite3 -line epsrc.db "select * from grants where id='GR/J50118/01'"
                           id = GR/J50118/01
                        title = USE OF CATALYTIC MEMBRANES FOR IN SITU REACTION AND SEPARATION
                        value = 114608
    principal_investigator_id = 40792
                department_id = 5273
                   created_at = 2011-06-16 12:36:35.164790
                  modified_at = 2011-06-16 12:36:35.164800
                     
## Warnings

Be careful with the data this scraper generates. Care has been taken to sanitize the data, but as with any scraper, there may be inconsistencies or missing entries. Please [let me know](https://github.com/nickstenning/epsrc-gow/issues) if you find any problems.
